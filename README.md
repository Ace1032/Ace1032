## Projects:
[AndroidFundamentals](https://github.com/Ace1032/AndroidFundamentals)
AndroidFundamental encompasses a comprehensive range of foundational Android concepts. This project is designed for educational purposes.

[SocialApp](https://github.com/Ace1032/AndroidFundamentals/tree/main/Heart2Heart_1/app/src/main/java/com/example/heart2heart_1): This sample app offers three main functionalities: a main page for displaying news articles, an activity screen for viewing individual and upcoming activities, and a chat feature for team communication. Each screen is created using fragments that observe LiveData from dedicated ViewModels. These ViewModels share a common DataRepository, ensuring efficient data management and real-time updates across the app. This structure enhances performance, responsiveness, and code maintainability.
